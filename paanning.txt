Recipe App API Planning
The Recipe App API is designed to serve as the backend for a recipe-sharing platform, enabling users to manage recipes effectively. The API will support basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) and utilize MongoDB for efficient data storage. Below is the detailed plan:

1. Project Objectives
Develop a RESTful API to manage recipes.
Ensure scalability for future features such as user authentication, search, and categorization.
Maintain a clear and modular architecture for ease of development and maintenance.
2. Core Features
Create Recipes: Allow users to add recipes with a title, description, ingredients, and instructions.
Read Recipes: Provide endpoints to fetch all recipes or a specific recipe by ID.
Update Recipes: Allow users to update existing recipes.
Delete Recipes: Provide functionality to remove recipes from the database.
3. Technology Stack
Backend Framework: Node.js with Express.js.
Database: MongoDB for storing and managing recipe data.
Environment Variables: dotenv for managing sensitive configuration data.
Middleware: body-parser for parsing JSON requests.
4. API Endpoints
POST /api/recipes: Add a new recipe to the database.
GET /api/recipes: Retrieve all recipes.
GET /api/recipes/:id: Fetch a recipe by its unique ID.
PUT /api/recipes/:id: Update an existing recipe by ID.
DELETE /api/recipes/:id: Delete a recipe by ID.
5. Folder Structure
The application will follow a modular folder structure for clarity and maintainability:

routes/: Contains route definitions for the API.
models/: Defines the database schema for recipes.
server.js: Entry point for the application, handling server initialization and middleware setup.
.env: Stores environment variables like the database connection string.
package.json: Manages project dependencies and scripts.

6. Development Steps
Initial Setup

Set up a Node.js project and install necessary dependencies: express, mongoose, body-parser, dotenv.
Configure the .env file with sensitive data such as the MongoDB connection string.
Database Design

Define a recipe schema with fields like title, description, ingredients (array), instructions, and timestamps.
Implement API Endpoints

Create route handlers for CRUD operations using Express.js.
Connect the routes to MongoDB using Mongoose.
Middleware Integration

Add body-parser to handle JSON payloads in incoming requests.
Testing

Use Postman or a similar tool to test API functionality and debug issues.

7. Future Features

User Authentication: Add user login and recipe ownership.
Search and Filters: Implement search functionality to filter recipes based on keywords or ingredients.
Categories and Tags: Enable categorization of recipes, such as vegan, desserts, or quick meals.
File Uploads: Allow users to upload recipe images.
Pagination: Introduce pagination for large datasets to improve performance.
